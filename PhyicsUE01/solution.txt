1a) An automobile traveling 95 km/h overtakes a 1.30-km-long train traveling in the same direction on a track parallel to the road.
    If the trainâ€™s speed is 75 km/h, how long does it take the car to pass it, and how far will the car have traveled in this time?
        1.30km/(95km/h - 75km/h) = 0.065h => 3min 54s
        95km/h * 0.065h = 6.175km

b)  Opposite Direction?
        1.10/(95km/h + 75km/h) = 0.00647h => 27.5s
        95km/h * 0.00647h = 0.6147km => 614.7 m


2)  Suppose you adjust your garden hose nozzle for a fast stream of water.
    You point the nozzle vertically upward at a height of 1.8 m above the ground.
    When you quickly turn off the nozzle, you hear the water striking the ground next to you for another 2.5 s.
    What is the water speed as it leaves the nozzle?

    s = v*t + 1/2*a*t^2
    -1.8m = 2.5s * v + ((-9.81 m/s^2)/2) * 2.5^2
    v = 11.54 m/s


3)  A rescue plane wants to drop supplies to isolated mountain climbers on a rocky ridge 235 m below. 
    If the plane is traveling horizontally with a speed of 250 km/h (69.4 m/s), 
    how far in advance of the recipients (horizontal distance) must the goods be dropped

    //no velocity
    235m = ((-9.81 m/s^2)/2) * t^2
    t = 6.92s

    //no acceleration
    s = (69.4 m/s) * 6.92s 
    s = 480.25m
